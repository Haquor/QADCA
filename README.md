# What QADCA is

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away
An anime themed social networking and forum site called Gaiaonline began to feature games.

The games ran on Adobe Flash and were developed in ActionScript. Using a shockwave flash file (SWF) decompiler, anyone could read the code for the game, and even recompile their own versions of Gaia's popular flash games.

# GAIA Fishing

One such game featured allowed players to catch and sell fish. While pouring over the code, I noticed a neat little proprietary encryption function, unique (as far as I know), to Gaiaonline. That encryption was identified only by QADCA.

While writing an interface to GAIA Fishing in AutoIt, I noticed a few other programmers found it tedious to convert the encryption. I'd uploaded the ActionScript files along with my AutoIt port to save time.


### Aftermath
Since this project was originally uploaded. Gaiaonline has practically gone out of business. Its user base is at an all time low, and the era of Gaia game cheats is over.

Rest in Peace GAIA
